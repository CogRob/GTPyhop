GTPyhop is an automated planning system that extends the [Pyhop](https://bitbucket.org/dananau/pyhop/) planner to plan for both tasks and goals. GTPyhop plans for tasks in the same way as Pyhop [[Nau13](#Nau13)], and is mostly backward-compatible with Pyhop. The way it plans for goals is based on the GDP algorithm [[Shi12](#Shi12)].

A GTPyhop planning problem is specified by a *todo list* that contains tasks, actions, and goals. To construct a solution plan, GTPyhop goes one by one through the items in the todo list. Here are the possibilities for each item:

  - If it is an applicable action, GTPyhop applies it to update the current state, and appends it to the solution plan.
  - If it is a task, GTPyhop looks through the list of relevant tasks methods, and applies the first one that is applicable. This produces a (possibly empty) list of tasks, actions, and goals that GTPyhop inserts into the todo list.
  - If it is a goal *g*, GTPyhop looks through the list of relevant goal methods, and applies the first one that is applicable. This produces a (possibly empty) list of tasks, actions, and goals that GTPyhop inserts into the todo list, along with a way to check whether they actually achieve *g*.
  - If a failure occurs (e.g., the action is inapplicable, or a goal or task that has no applicable methods, or a goal method doesn't achieve its goal), GTPyhop backtracks to choose different methods for earlier tasks and goals in the todo list.

GTPyhop also includes:

  - A `Domain` class to contain the actions, commands, tasks, goals, and methods for a planning and acting domain. This makes it possible to import multiple domains during a single Python run, without them interfering with each other.
  
  - An implementation of a simple acting algorithm called Run-Lazy-Lookahead [[Gha16](#Gha16)], a way to declare commands for the actor to perform, and several examples of integrated planning and acting using Run-Lazy-Lookahead and GTPyhop.
  
  - A simple test harness that's useful for running and debugging examples.
  
  - Several example planning and acting domains (see below).

### Further reading

  - The best overall description of GTPyhop is [[Nau21](#Nau21)].
  - [Some GTPyhop Details](Some_GTPyhop_Details.md) discusses some details of GTPyhop's operation, compares it to some other planners, and discusses backward-compatibility with Pyhop.
  - GTPyhop does a totally-ordered version of Goal-Task-Network (GTN) planning without sharing and task insertion. For precise definitions of those terms and their theoretical properties, see [[Alf16](#Alf16)].
